    <h1>French-Fries</h1>
    <img src="french-fries.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The perfect french fries recipe! Based on a ground-breaking method from the legendary Kenji López-Alt’s The Food Lab, these hot chips are so crispy they stay that way even after they’ve gone cold. It’s rare to find fries this good even at up-market bistros!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut into 1cm-thick batons. Put into a bowl of cold water and leave to soak for at least 2 hrs to remove the starch from the potatoes – this will help them crisp while frying.</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes well and pat dry with kitchen paper. Fill a deep pan no more than a third full with oil and heat to 140C, or until a cube of bread dropped in browns in 60 seconds. Fry the French fries in batches for 6 mins per batch until golden straw-coloured, cooked through and lightly crisp. Drain well on kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat up until the oil reaches 180C, or a cube of bread browns in 30 seconds. Fry the French fries again for 2-3 mins per batch until lightly golden and really crisp. Drain on kitchen paper and immediately season with sea salt.</li>
    </ol>
